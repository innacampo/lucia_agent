# LUCIA Agent Tests

This directory contains integration tests for the `root_agent`.

## How to Run

You can run the test from the root of the project using the following command:

```bash
python -m tests.test_agent
```

## Test Scenario

The `test_agent.py` script is an integration test that runs the `root_agent` through a predefined user querie. This test is designed to simulate a typical conversation with the agent and ensure that it can handle the flow without errors.

The script will print the agent's responses to the console for the query.
